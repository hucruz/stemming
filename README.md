Stemming Algorithms for Text Mining and Natural Language Processing.
## Algorithms
### Brute Force
Brute force stemmers employ a lookup table which contains relations between root forms and inflected forms.
### Affix Stripping
Affix refers to either a prefix or a suffix.
Affix Stripping Algorithms consists of list of "rules" which provide a path for the algorithm.
* Paice/Husk Stemming Algorithm
* Porter Stemming Algorithm
* Krovetz Stemming Algorithm
* Dawson Stemming Algorithm
### Lemmatization
This process involves applying different normalization rules for each part of speech of a word.
